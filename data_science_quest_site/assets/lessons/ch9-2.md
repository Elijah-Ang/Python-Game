# Sorting (Basic)

**Concepts:**
- Sorting is organizing data
- Python's `sorted()` vs manual sorting

**Why it matters:** Sorting supports ranking, percentiles, deduping, and faster searching.

## Steps
1. Sort a list ascending.
2. Sort descending.
3. Print both.

## Try it
Given `nums = [5, 1, 9, 2]`,
print `sorted(nums)` and `sorted(nums, reverse=True)`.
