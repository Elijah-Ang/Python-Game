# Exceptions

**Concepts:**
- `try` / `except`
- Stable programs

**Why it matters:** Real programs handle messy data and errors without crashing.

## Steps
1. Wrap risky code in try/except.
2. Print a helpful message on failure.
3. Continue execution.

## Try it
Try to convert `s = "not_a_number"` into int.
Catch the exception and print `Could not convert`.
