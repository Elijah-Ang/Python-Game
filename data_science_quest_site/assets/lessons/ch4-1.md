# Defining Functions

**Concepts:**
- `def name():`
- Calling functions

**Why it matters:** Functions help you reuse logic and keep code clean.

## Steps
1. Write a function with no parameters.
2. Call it twice.
3. Make it print something meaningful.

## Try it
Write a function `greet()` that prints `Hello, Data Scientist!`.
Call it two times.
