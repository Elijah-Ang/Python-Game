# Logical Operators

**Concepts:**
- `and`, `or`, `not`
- Compound conditions

**Why it matters:** Real decisions usually depend on multiple conditions at once.

## Steps
1. Create two conditions.
2. Combine them with `and` and `or`.
3. Use `not` to invert.

## Try it
Set `age = 17` and `has_pass = True`.
Print `can_enter` where:
- can_enter is True only if age >= 18 OR has_pass is True.
Then print `not can_enter`.
