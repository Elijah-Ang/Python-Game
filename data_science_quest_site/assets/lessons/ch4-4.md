# Scope

**Concepts:**
- Local vs global variables
- Lifetime of variables

**Why it matters:** Scope prevents bugs and makes programs predictable.

## Steps
1. Create a global variable.
2. Create a function that defines a local variable with the same name.
3. Print both to see the difference.

## Try it
Set `x = 100` globally.
Define `def demo():` inside it set `x = 5` and print x.
Call demo() then print global x.
