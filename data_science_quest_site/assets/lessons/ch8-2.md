# Visualization: Customization (Conceptual)

**Concepts:**
- Labels, titles, legends
- Readable charts

**Why it matters:** Most bad charts fail because of labeling, scaling, and clutter.

## Steps
1. Write a short checklist for a readable chart.
2. Print it.

## Try it
Create a list called `checklist` with at least 5 items (e.g., "Clear title").
Loop through and print each item prefixed with `- `.
