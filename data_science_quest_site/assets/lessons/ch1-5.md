# Boss: Sand Sphinx Integration

**Concepts:**
- Combine variables, strings, math, formatting
- Build a tiny real program

**Why it matters:** This is where isolated concepts become a program that *does something* end-to-end.

> Integration bosses teach you that programs are just many small pieces working together.

## Steps
1. Create inputs as variables (pretend user input for now).
2. Compute something meaningful.
3. Print a well-formatted result.

## Try it
Build a tiny receipt calculator:
- `item = "Bubble Tea"`
- `qty = 2`
- `price = 4.90`
Compute `total = qty * price`.
Print: `2x Bubble Tea costs $9.80` (use an f-string and format to 2 decimals).
