# Statistics: Variance (Conceptual + Simple)

**Concepts:**
- Variance measures spread
- Large variance = values far from mean

**Why it matters:** Variance and standard deviation tell you how stable/noisy data is.

## Steps
1. Compute mean.
2. Compute average squared distance.
3. Print variance.

## Try it
Given `nums = [1, 2, 3]`,
compute variance as average of (x-mean)^2.
Print variance.
