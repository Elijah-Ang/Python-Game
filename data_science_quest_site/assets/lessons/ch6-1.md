# Open / Read / Write

**Concepts:**
- Read text files
- Write output files

**Why it matters:** Data science is useless without loading datasets and saving results.

## Steps
1. Open a file for writing and write lines.
2. Open the same file for reading.
3. Print what you read.

## Try it
Write to a file named `note.txt` the line: `hello file!`
Then read it back and print it.
