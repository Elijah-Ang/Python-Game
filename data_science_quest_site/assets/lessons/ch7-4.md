# Pandas: Group & Aggregate

**Concepts:**
- `groupby()`
- Aggregations like sum/mean/count

**Why it matters:** Grouping is the core of analytics dashboards and reports.

## Steps
1. Group by a column.
2. Compute sum.
3. Sort results.

## Try it
Group sales by `region` and compute total revenue per region.
Print the result sorted by revenue descending.
