# Tuples

**Concepts:**
- Ordered, immutable collection
- Useful for fixed records

**Why it matters:** Tuples are great for coordinates, fixed records, and keys.

## Steps
1. Create a tuple.
2. Access elements.
3. Show that you can't change it (comment that line out).

## Try it
Create `point = (3, 7)`.
Print x and y from the tuple.
