# ML: Train/Test Split (Conceptual)

**Concepts:**
- Why we split
- Overfitting intuition

**Why it matters:** Without a fair test set, you can fool yourself into thinking a model is good.

## Steps
1. Explain overfitting in plain language.
2. Print a tiny example scenario.

## Try it
Print:
- One simple sentence explaining overfitting.
- One simple example of how a model can memorize training data.
