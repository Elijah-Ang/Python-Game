# Visualization: Plot Types (Conceptual)

**Concepts:**
- Line, bar, scatter (what each is best for)
- Mapping data → visuals

**Why it matters:** Insights are useless unless humans can see them.

## Steps
1. Describe which plot type fits which question.
2. Then write code that prints a 'plot plan' (title, x, y).

## Try it
Make variables:
`title = "Revenue by Region"`
`x = "region"`
`y = "revenue"`
Print a plan like: `Plot: Revenue by Region | x=region | y=revenue`
