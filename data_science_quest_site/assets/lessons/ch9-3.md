# Big O (Conceptual)

**Concepts:**
- Time complexity intuition
- Input size grows → runtime grows

**Why it matters:** Big O helps you predict performance and avoid slow pipelines.

## Steps
1. Write a short mapping of common Big O types.
2. Print it nicely.

## Try it
Create a dict mapping:
`"O(1)"`, `"O(log n)"`, `"O(n)"`, `"O(n log n)"`, `"O(n^2)"`
to a plain-English sentence.
Loop and print each line.
