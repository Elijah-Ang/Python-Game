# Pandas: Filter

**Concepts:**
- Boolean filtering
- Selecting subsets

**Why it matters:** Filtering is how you focus on the slice that matters.

## Steps
1. Filter by region.
2. Select specific columns.
3. Print results.

## Try it
Filter sales where region is `"East"`.
Print only `date`, `category`, `revenue`.
