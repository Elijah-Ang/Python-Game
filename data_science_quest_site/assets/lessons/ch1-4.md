# Booleans

**Concepts:**
- `True` / `False`
- Boolean variables
- Truth in comparisons like `==`, `>`, `<`

**Why it matters:** Every decision (if/else) is powered by booleans.

## Steps
1. Create boolean variables.
2. Use comparisons to create booleans.
3. Print the results.

## Try it
Set `x = 10` and `y = 12`.
Print:
- `x == y`
- `x < y`
- `x >= 10`
