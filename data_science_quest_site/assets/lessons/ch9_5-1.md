# Statistics: Mean & Median

**Concepts:**
- Mean (average)
- Median (middle value)

**Why it matters:** Descriptive stats are the grammar of data analysis.

## Steps
1. Compute mean manually.
2. Compute median manually (assume odd length).
3. Print both.

## Try it
Given `nums = [2, 3, 10, 10, 15]`,
compute mean and median (nums is already sorted).
Print them.
