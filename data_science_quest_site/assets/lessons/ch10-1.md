# Machine Learning: The Pipeline

**Concepts:**
- Train/test split
- Regression, classification, clustering
- Hyperparameter tuning (what it is)

**Why it matters:** ML turns raw data into predictions and decisions.

## Steps
1. Write the pipeline steps as a numbered list in code.
2. Print them.

## Try it
Make a list called `pipeline` with:
1) Load data
2) Clean data
3) Split train/test
4) Train model
5) Evaluate
6) Tune
7) Deploy
Loop and print with step numbers.
