# For Loops

**Concepts:**
- Iterate over lists, ranges, strings
- Loop variable lifecycle

**Why it matters:** Loops are the engine of automation: data processing, simulations, ML training, and more.

## Steps
1. Loop over a list of values.
2. Accumulate a total.
3. Print during the loop for visibility.

## Try it
Given `nums = [3, 5, 2, 10]`, use a for-loop to compute the sum.
Print the final sum.
