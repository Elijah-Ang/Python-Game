# Variables

**Concepts:**
- Assignment: `name = value`
- Naming rules (letters, numbers, underscores; not starting with a number)
- Overwriting values
- Memory idea: variable → object

**Why it matters:** Everything in programming is storing and moving data. This is the foundation of all code.

> Think of a variable as a *label* pointing at a value.

## Steps
1. Create 2 variables and print them.
2. Overwrite one variable and print again.
3. Use a clear variable name.

## Try it
Write code that prints:
1) your `name`
2) your `age`
Then overwrite `age` with `age + 1` and print the new value.
