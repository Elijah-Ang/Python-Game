# While Loops

**Concepts:**
- Condition-controlled loops
- Termination logic
- Preventing infinite loops

**Why it matters:** While-loops are perfect when you don’t know the number of repeats ahead of time.

## Steps
1. Initialize a counter.
2. Loop while a condition is true.
3. Update the counter so the loop ends.

## Try it
Start `n = 5`.
Use a while-loop to print:
5
4
3
2
1
